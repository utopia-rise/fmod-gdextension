**Godot 4 GDExtension that integrates with the FMOD Studio API.** [FMOD is an audio engine and middleware solution](https://www.fmod.com/) for interactive audio in games. It has been the audio engine behind many
titles such as **Transistor**, **Into the Breach** and **Celeste**. This Godot extension is used by games such as [Koira](https://dont-nod.com/en/games/koira/).

# Installation

2. Unpack the `addons/fmod` folder into your `/addons` folder within the Godot project
3. Enable this addon within the Godot settings: `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`

## How this extension works

This GDExtension exposes most of the Studio API functions to Godot's GDScript and also provides helpers for performing
common functions like attaching Studio events to Godot nodes and playing 3D/positional audio.

> **Note:** FMOD also provides a C# wrapper for their API which is used in the Unity integration and it is possible to use the
same wrapper to build an integration for Godot in C#. However do note that this would only work on a Mono build of Godot
as C# support is required and performance might not be on the same level as a C++ integration.

## Continuous Delivery

This project uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to continuously deploy released drivers. If you do not want to use those releases, you
can compile from sources by looking to [compile from sources section](./docs/src/doc/advanced/1-compiling.md). This project uses [SEMVER](https://semver.org/).

# Special Thanks

This project is a forked from [godot-fmod-integration](https://github.com/alexfonseka/godot-fmod-integration)
from [alexfonseka](https://github.com/alexfonseka). We'd like to thank him for the work he did, we simply adapted his
work to GDNative.
