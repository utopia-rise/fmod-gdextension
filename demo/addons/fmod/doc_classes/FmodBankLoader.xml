		A node for automatically loading FMOD Studio banks when entering the scene tree.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		FmodBankLoader is a utility node that automatically loads FMOD Studio bank files when it enters the scene tree. This provides a convenient way to ensure that required audio content is loaded before it's needed.

		Banks contain the audio content and metadata for FMOD Studio events, including:
		- Event definitions and parameters
		- Audio samples (if not streamed)
		- Bus and VCA configurations
		- Mixing and effect settings

		The node accepts an array of bank file paths and loads them all when _enter_tree() is called. Banks are loaded with the default loading mode, which is typically asynchronous to avoid blocking the main thread.

		This is particularly useful for loading banks at the start of a level or scene, ensuring all required audio content is available when events are played.

		Note: Banks must be available in the project's resources or file system at the specified paths.

		<method name="set_bank_paths">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="p_paths" type="Array" />
			<description>
				Sets the array of bank file paths to load. Each path should be a string pointing to a .bank file. The banks will be loaded when the node enters the scene tree.
